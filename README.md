# Agentic Mesh 

## Overview

The Multi-Agent Task Orchestrator is a scalable and modular system designed to coordinate and execute tasks across a network of specialized agents. The orchestrator manages task dependencies, assigns tasks to the most suitable agents, and ensures that complex workflows are executed efficiently in a distributed environment.

## Features

- Centralized task orchestration and coordination.
- Dependency management for sequential task execution.
- Dynamic agent discovery and task assignment based on capabilities.
- Robust error handling for network requests and task failures.
- Asynchronous task handling simulation with dependency tracking.

## Overview

The Agentic Mesh Plane is a distributed multi-agent system designed to execute complex workflows through orchestrated task coordination. The system leverages various services that work together to ensure efficient task execution, collaboration between agents, and robust handling of dependencies.

## Key Services

### 1. Orchestrator Service
- **Purpose**: Manages the execution of tasks by coordinating between agents based on a provided execution plan.
- **Functionality**:
  - Parses the execution plan and handles task dependencies.
  - Finds and engages suitable agents for task execution.
  - Monitors task progress and completion, with error handling and retries.

### 2. Registry Service
- **Purpose**: Maintains records of all agents in the network, including their capabilities, state, and metadata.
- **Functionality**:
  - Registers new agents.
  - Stores agent capabilities and other metadata.
  - Provides a central repository for agent lookups based on different criteria.

### 3. Discovery Service
- **Purpose**: Enables dynamic discovery of agents based on specific criteria, such as capabilities, purpose, or policies.
- **Functionality**:
  - Facilitates searching and filtering for agents.
  - Supports efficient communication and coordination among agents.

### 4. Communication Service (Message Bus)
- **Purpose**: Manages asynchronous communication between agents and services within the mesh network.
- **Functionality**:
  - Provides messaging patterns like publish-subscribe and request-response.
  - Ensures reliable message delivery and reduces latency through decoupled communication.

### 5. GenAI Service (Generative AI Service)
- **Purpose**: Acts as a knowledge engine for generating execution plans, providing insights, and enhancing agent interactions using natural language models.
- **Functionality**:
  - Generates detailed execution plans.
  - Provides natural language interfaces for agent interactions and problem-solving.

### 6. Execution Engine
- **Purpose**: Executes tasks based on an agent's specific capabilities.
- **Functionality**:
  - Accepts and processes tasks assigned by the orchestrator or other agents.
  - Communicates results and feedback to the orchestrator or initiating agents.
  - Engages with other agents when collaboration is needed.

### 7. Policy and Security Service
- **Purpose**: Ensures all interactions within the mesh network adhere to defined policies and security standards.
- **Functionality**:
  - Enforces access control, authentication, and authorization for all communications.
  - Monitors compliance with data privacy and security policies.
  - Provides audit logs and monitoring for all interactions.

### 8. Agent Marketplace Service (Optional)
- **Purpose**: Offers a centralized view of available agents and their capabilities, facilitating user or service selection.
- **Functionality**:
  - Provides search and filtering tools to find suitable agents.
  - Allows easy engagement of agents for specific tasks.

## How the Services Work Together

### 1. Task Initialization
- The Orchestrator Service receives a request to execute a complex task and generates an execution plan (optionally using the GenAI Service).
- The execution plan outlines the required tasks, their dependencies, and capabilities needed.

### 2. Agent Discovery and Assignment
- The Orchestrator uses the Registry and Discovery Services to find suitable agents for each task.
- Tasks are dynamically assigned to agents based on their capabilities and current state.

### 3. Task Execution and Collaboration
- Agents execute tasks, report progress, and collaborate when necessary.
- The Communication Service ensures smooth, reliable communication between agents and services.

### 4. Monitoring and Feedback
- The Orchestrator tracks task progress, manages retries, and ensures dependencies are met.
- Agents provide feedback and results, creating a feedback loop for the orchestrator.

### 5. Security and Policy Enforcement
- The Policy and Security Service governs all interactions, ensuring compliance with security standards and access control policies.

## Conclusion

The Agentic Mesh Plane leverages modular, interconnected services to create a scalable and resilient multi-agent system. Each service contributes to efficient task coordination, agent collaboration, and secure, compliant communication, making it ideal for executing complex workflows.
